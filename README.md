## My process

Building an API using React using UseEffect and TailwindCSS to be familiar of the framework and adapting a pagination for large arrays of data that will be rendered (minimized the display data per page)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

line-clamp -
implementing pagination from other source
custom hook
useMemo hook

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
